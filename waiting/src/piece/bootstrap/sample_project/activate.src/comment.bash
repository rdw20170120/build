# Activate the BriteOnyx framework to manage this project directory tree

# NOTE: This script, and EVERY script that it calls, must NOT invoke 'exit'!  The user calling this
#   script must be allowed to preserve their shell and every effort must be made to inform the user
#   of problems while continuing execution where possible.  Terminating the shell robs the user of
#   useful feedback and interrupts their work, which is unacceptable.  Instead, the BASH 'return'
#   statement should be invoked to end execution with an appropriate status code.
