Things TODO for this project

* Within each project tree that uses BriteOnyx, consider creating a temporary
  directory into which we assemble the complete contents from this BriteOnyx
  that are needed by that project, then put that temporary directory on the
  project's PATH so that there is no further reference back to BriteOnyx
* Enhance the use of SLOCcount to include the relevant files from BriteOnyx
* Refactor BriteOnyx so that it is bootstrapped into a using project, but
  afterwards leaves no residual other than the relevant BriteOnyx files needed
  to support that project
