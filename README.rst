=========

BriteOnyx provides a reusable infrastructure for building software on various
development platforms.  Ultimately, the intent is to establish a continuous
delivery environment with minimal overhead in each project's directory tree.

Target platforms
----------------
#. Python on Linux
#. CoffeeScript on Linux
#. Java on Linux
#. Python on Windows
#. Java on Windows
#. .NET on Windows

So far Linux means Ubuntu (probably Lucid Lynx 10.04+) and Windows means
Windows 7 and Windows 2008 R2.  Python means 2.6+, Java means 1.6+, while
CoffeeScript and .NET will be recent versions but are not yet precisely
defined.
